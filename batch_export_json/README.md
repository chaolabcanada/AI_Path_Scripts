Batch Export Json annotations
=============================
This script allows you to batch export the annotations from a QuPath project.

Usage:
======

Run the script on QuPath software

A file-chooser window should then pop up allowing you to choose the folder where you would like to export the json annotation files to. Once chosen, the script will run.
You can watch the annotations be extracted and saved in the window below the script entry area as the line "Annotation saved to [filename and output directory]" is printed with each image/annotation file :)

Batch Export Json Annotations
=============================
This script allows you to batch export annotations from a QuPath project.

Usage:
======

* Run the script through [QuPath software](https://qupath.github.io/) upon a project containing images.

* A file-chooser prompt will appear. Select a folder where the new json annotation files can be exported into. 

The script will now run. 
While the script iterates through each image in the project, you can monitor the progress of the json annotations being exported/saved through the script output box.

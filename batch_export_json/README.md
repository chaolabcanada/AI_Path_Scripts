Batch Export Json annotations
=============================
This script allows you to batch export the annotations from a QuPath project.

Usage:
======

* Run the script through QuPath software upon a project containing images.

* A file-chooser prompt will appear. Select a folder where the json annotation files will be exported into. 

* Once chosen, the script will run. 
While the script iterates through each image in the QuPath project, you can watch the annotations being saved in the window below the script entry area as the line "Annotation saved to [filename and output directory]" is printed.

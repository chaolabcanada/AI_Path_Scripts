Batch Export Json annotations
=============================
This script allows you to batch export the annotations from a QuPath project.

Usage:
======

* Run the script on QuPath software.

* A file-chooser window will appear. Select a folder to export the json annotation files into. 

* Once chosen, the script will run. 
You can watch the annotations be extracted and saved in the window below the script entry area as the line "Annotation saved to [filename and output directory]" is printed with each image/annotation file.

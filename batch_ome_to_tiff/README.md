Batch convert MRXS files to OME-TIFF format
===========================================
This script allows you to batch or single convert MRXS files into JPEG compressed pyramidal ome.tiff files through the use of [Fiji-ImageJ Software](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads)

Usage:
======

* Run the script through ImageJ upon a project containing images.

* A file-chooser prompt will appear. Select a folder where the new json annotation files can be exported into. 

The script will now run. 
While the script iterates through each image in the project, you can monitor the progress of the json annotations being exported/saved through the script output box.

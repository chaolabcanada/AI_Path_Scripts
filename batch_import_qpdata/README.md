Batch Import .qpdata Annotations
================================
This script allows you to batch import .qpdata files onto corresponding images using a groovy script that runs on QuPath.

Usage:
======

* Run the script through QuPath software upon a project containing images.

* A prompt will appear for choosing a directory. Select the directory containing the .qpdata files.

* Once chosen, the script will run. 
While the script iterates through each image in the project, you can monitor the progress of the annotations being imported through the script output box.
